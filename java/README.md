We've tried 3 different libraries and found `jackson` to be the best, especially working together with `JSONGen`.

### Jackson - Best

Pros: simple, works well will `JSONGen` (which generates your classes for you)

Cons: larger in size

### Google GSON - Good

Pros: Google has a hand in it, nice for ad-hoc json parsing

Cons: not as simple as Jackson for full classes

### JSON-lib - Good

Pros: It's based on the reference implementation

Cons: has dependencies
