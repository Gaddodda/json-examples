# Working With The API In Ruby

`api.rb` is a simple API wrapper for interacting with the Spotter.

You can request resources, and get and set settings on a specific unit.

## Installation and Setup

This code was tested on Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.2. It doesn't do anything
too crazy, so it should work in other versions of Ruby just fine.

You also need a working installation of RubyGems. If you don't have it, see
[rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org) for help installing it.:w

The only dependency is the `json` gem. Install it like-a-so.

    gem install json

If you have problems installing these gems, see the
[json](http://flori.github.com/json/) gem website.

## TODO

* better error handling
* use RDoc format
